This project is via tutorials from Scrimba.
As a learner of javascript, I've benefited from the concepts that wraps around it.

The goal is to do more and more till I'm proficient.
Feel free to note any kind of possible improvement to the current work as it'll go a long -
way for me in terms of learning.

Thanks.
